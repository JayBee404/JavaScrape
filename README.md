# Web Scraper and Wordlist Generator

This project was created as part of a (CTF) challenge while I was in school. It consists of two Java files: `GetHTML.java` and `ParseHTML.java`, which together form a web scraper and wordlist generator.

## Project Structure

- `MineLinks.java`: Fetches the HTML content of a specified URL and saves it to a file. Make sure to edit the source link and output file before running/compiling.
- `ParseHTML.java`: Parses the saved HTML content, extracts specific information using a regex pattern, and generates a wordlist. Once again, make sure to designate the input and output filenames before running/compiling.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An internet connection to access the target webpages.
